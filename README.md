This project is an **intentional experiment in bad UX and deceptive design patterns**, designed to frustrate users at every possible step. It challenges conventional usability principles by **deliberately breaking expectations, disrupting user flow, and obstructing interactions**.  

🚨 **Disclaimer:** This project is purely for entertainment. No real money is involved. It does not intend to harm or offend any individuals or cultural sentiments.

## **🎭 Rationale: Why This Exists?**  

This project **explores the impact of bad UX design** and **dark patterns** through a controlled but exaggerated experience. It aims to:  

### **🔍 1. Expose Manipulative UX Patterns**  
Many websites **mislead users** with frustrating design tricks to increase engagement, force purchases, or extract data. This project **intensifies these manipulations** to make them obvious.  

### **⏳ 2. Study User Patience and Behavior**  
By introducing **intentionally frustrating mechanics**, this project examines **how long users tolerate** deceptive design before quitting or trying to find workarounds.  

### **⚠️ 3. Expose the Reality of Scam Websites**  
The **"Win 10 Lakhs Rupees"** theme mirrors **online scams** that promise unrealistic rewards but lead to **hidden costs, fake payments, and data theft**. This site mocks those scams **by making the deception so absurd, it becomes obvious**.

## **🚫 Anti-Patterns & Frustrating Mechanics**  

### **1️⃣ The Unfillable Form**  
- **Typing your name?** It **automatically changes** to something else (e.g., "🍛 DOSA").  
- **Clicking the name field?** Endless popups appear, questioning your ability to remember your own name.  
- **Trying to enter a college name?** The input **fills with emojis** and random characters instead.  

### **2️⃣ The Unclickable Submit Button**  
- **First 60 seconds?** The submit button is **completely unclickable**.  
- **After 1 minute?** It **moves away** every time you try to click it.  
- **After 2 minutes?** It **stops moving—but gets covered in popups instead**.  

### **3️⃣ Visual & Audio Chaos**  
- **Flashing background colors** create an overstimulating experience.  
- **Cursor changes randomly**—sometimes it’s a loading icon, sometimes it disappears entirely.  
- **Random sound effects & music** play without warning.  
- **The screen shakes violently** at unpredictable intervals.  

### **4️⃣ Popup Spam & Obstructive Elements**  
- **Click anywhere?** A popup appears. Click again? Another one appears.  
- **Trying to close a popup?** It **moves away** or triggers **even more popups**.  
- **After a while, the screen is completely covered**, making navigation impossible.  

### **5️⃣ The Final Deception**  
- **Successfully submit the form?** A **"Congratulations! You’ve almost won 10 Lakhs Rupees!"** message appears.  
- **To claim the prize?** You must **pay a ₹999 processing fee**.  
- **Try to pay?** "ERROR: Payment failed. Please try again in 24 hours."  
- **Everything resets**, forcing you to start over.
